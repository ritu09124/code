      <p>Knowledge of human nature is the ability to correctly assess the behavior or character of people based on a first impression, and to gauge how they think and predict how they will act. Life experience, intuition, intelligence, and wisdom are the decisive factors which contribute to this ability.</p>

  <h1>Section 2</h1>
  <p>Despite of its long-lasting theological tradition and its deep-rooting into the very birth of philosophy, the theme of the natural knowledge of God has always been the subject of critical debate. Starting from the Modern Age, the different theological perspectives on this subject were mainly due to different understandings of the dynamic between faith and reason</p>
  
</div>

<div id="section3" class="container-fluid bg-secondary text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
  <h1>Section 3</h1>
  <p>It is important to distinguish and explain the meaning of two different approaches, that of a “natural knowledge of God” and that of a “revelation of God in creation.” The two approaches are clearly linked to each other, but they are also distinct. The former is a philosophical journey that leads to an image of the “Absolute” that is dependent on the specific method that was chosen (metaphysical, phenomenological, cosmological, anthropological, etc.); the latter one is a theological issue concerning theology of Revelation.</p>
