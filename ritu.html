<h2>natural views information</h2>

<p>Over the years qualification and amendment to the legislation has made it clear that natural beauty is not just scenery but includes landform and geology, plants and animals, the historic environment and cultural heritage.</p>

<div>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.Aesthetics of nature is a sub-field of philosophical ethics, and refers to the study of nature from the aesthetical perspective. In a Post-Modern approach, when an individual engages in aesthetically appreciating nature, they give meaning to it and in that meaning express and develop themselves.</div>
